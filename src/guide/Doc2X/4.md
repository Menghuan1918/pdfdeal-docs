> ==After version 0.3.1== the output has been updated to `logging`, which by default only outputs Warning and above. If you want to see the processing, set the `logging` level to INFO:
> ```python
> import logging
> httpx_logger = logging.getLogger("httpx")
> httpx_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
> ```
> For demonstration purposes, the following code examples all set the `logging` level to INFO.
