## `Client.pdfdeal`

Process PDF files and convert them into files more suitable for the RAG system.

> [!caution]
> If you want to convert PDF files to other formats, please use the [Client.pdf2file](2.md) function

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `pdf_file` | `str` or `list` | Yes | - | Input file path, or a list of input file paths |
| `output_format` | `str` | No | `"pdf"` | Output format, accepts `'pdf'`, `'md'` or `'texts'`. Default is `"pdf"` |
| `output_names` | `list` | No | `None` | Custom output file names, must match the length of `pdf_file`. If the file name contains a folder path, the system will automatically create the corresponding folder structure. Default is `None` |
| `output_path` | `str` | No | `"./Output"` | Output path. Default is `"./Output"` |
| `convert` | `bool` | No | `True` | Whether to convert `[` to `$`, and `[[` to `$$`. Default is `True` |

### Return Values

Returns a tuple `(list1, list2, bool)` containing three elements in the same order as the input files:

1. `list1` (`list`): List of successfully processed file paths
   - Elements are the paths of processed files (strings)
   - Empty string if processing failed

2. `list2` (`list`): List of failed files
   - Elements are dictionaries containing two keys:
     - `'error'`: Error message (string)
     - `'path'`: Path of the failed file (string)
   - Both keys have empty string values if processing succeeded

3. `bool`: Processing status
   - `True`: At least one file processing failed
   - `False`: All files processed successfully

### Notes

- The lengths of `list1` and `list2` are the same
- When the output format is `"texts"`, text is returned directly without saving to a file

## Example

> [!warning]
> Please ensure you have configured your key in environment variables as per the [initialization section](Init.md).

> [!warning]
> When the output format is PDF, the conversion process does not retain the original document's layout. The converted PDF only contains recognized text content and generates a new PDF according to the original page numbers. This approach may cause text to exceed page boundaries, affecting human reading. However, it does not affect RAG system content reading.
>
> The advantage is that it retains the PDF page number where the text is located, making it easier to trace back in the RAG system.

### Recognize all PDFs in a folder and output as recognized PDFs

To maintain the original file structure, use the built-in directory generation tool to generate paths for images that need processing:

```python
from pdfdeal import Doc2X
from pdfdeal import get_files

client = Doc2X()
file_list, rename = get_files(path="tests/pdf", mode="pdf", out="pdf")
success, failed, flag = client.pdfdeal(
    pdf_file=file_list,
    output_path="./Output/test/multiple/pdfdeal",
    output_names=rename,
)
print(success)
print(failed)
print(flag)
```
The file structure of `./tests/pdf` is:
```bash
pdf
├── sample_bad.pdf
├── sample.pdf
└── test
    └── sampleB.pdf
```

> Note that `sample_bad.pdf` is a corrupted file used for testing exception handling; it is normal for processing to fail.

Expected output:

```bash
