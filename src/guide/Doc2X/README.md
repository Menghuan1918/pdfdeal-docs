You can use abstract wrapped classes or just use asynchronous functions to initiate requests.

The library supports python versions 3.8-3.12 and has been tested on Windows/Linux/MacOS systems using GitHub Action, installed using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pdfdeal
```

You will then need to [initialize](./Init.md).
