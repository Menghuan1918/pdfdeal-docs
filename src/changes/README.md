## V0.4.0

> [!caution]
> The V1 interface of Doc2X will be deprecated in the near future! Please migrate to the V2 interface as soon as possible. Please check the [Interface Migration Guide](. /v1tov2.md) to see if any code changes are required for your scenario.
>
> **In most cases, you will not need to change any code**, and the `0.4.X` version will be as upwardly compatible with the `0.3.1` version as possible.

### âœ¨ Feature Changes

- Support for Doc2X V2 interface
- The `pdf2file` interface will automatically recognise the input as a `folder path` / `file path` / `list form file path` and process it, [view](../guide/pdf.md)
- `pdf2file` will automatically maintain the original file structure, no longer need to manually intervene, [View](../guide/pdf.md)
- Improve the error reporting hints, now its going to try to provide a solution for the errors reported

### ðŸš€ Other

- Optimise package dependencies, now only two small packages are needed, `httpx` and `pypdf`.
- Easier debug logging switches.

## V0.3.1

> [!caution]
> ==After version 0.3.1== the output has been updated to `logging`, which by default only outputs Warning and above. If you want to see the processing, set the `logging` level to INFO:
> ```python
> import logging
> httpx_logger = logging.getLogger("httpx")
> httpx_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
